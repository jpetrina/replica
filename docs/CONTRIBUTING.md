## Filing Issues

* We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/replica/replica/issues) exclusively for tracking bugs and feature requests (RFEs) for Replica.one.
* When filing an issue, specify which distribution and dependency versions you have installed.
* Please include an explanation how to reproduce the issue you are pointing out.

Following these guidelines makes it easier for us to process your issue, and ensures you receive adequate support.

## Posting Pull Requests

* Make sure to post PRs only relative to a very recent git master.
* Please make sure to test your change before submitting the PR.
* Before posting your PR make sure to run builds locally and after posting your PR make sure that the CI builds are successful as well.
* If you need to update the code in an existing PR, force-push into the same branch, overriding old commits with new versions.

## Final Words

Thank you for your contributions!
